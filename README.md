Haskeme
=======

A Scheme interpreter written in Haskell. Based on the interpreter at:

http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Write_Yourself_a_Scheme_in_48_Hours/First_Steps

Aims and next steps:

* Make the interpreter R5RS compliant
* Macros
* Tail call optimization
* Standard library
* More primitives (esp. mathematical functions)
* Improve numerical handling (rationals, floats, complex etc)
* Special forms: cond, case, backquote/unquote
